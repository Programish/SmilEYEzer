# SmilEYEzer
This repository contains the code to detect facial features' bounding boxes in a set of facial images taken from the FFHQ dataset. The code is written in Python and utilizes OpenCV for image processing.

* For each facial image, the code will output the coordinates of three bounding boxes:

_ Two bounding boxes enclosing the eyes, maximally covering each eye.
One bounding box enclosing the mouth.
